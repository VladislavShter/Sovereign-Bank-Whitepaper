# Sovereign Bank 🏦 🚀

**The first community-driven, non-custodial Web3 bank built for true financial sovereignty.**

Sovereign Bank is a decentralized financial ecosystem designed to empower freelancers, relocators, and individuals in high-inflation economies. We bridge the gap between DeFi and real-world payments without compromising your privacy or control.

## 🌟 Our Mission
In a world of increasing financial censorship and corporate surveillance, we offer a "Code is Law" alternative. Unlike traditional fintech giants, we don't hold your keys, and we don't demand your life story for a simple transaction.
