Sovereign Bank: The People's Web3 Bank
🌍 Mission
Sovereign Bank is built for real people—freelancers, relocators, and individuals in high-inflation countries—not for bankers or politicians. We are creating a financial system that is unstoppable, non-custodial, and truly sovereign.
🚀 Key Features
Non-Custodial Control: Users own their private keys. We never touch their funds.
Freedom Card: Anonymous, instant issuance (Email/TG), limits up to $1000.
Resident Card: Full-featured card with higher limits, assets secured in smart contracts.
Stablecoin Native: Seamless spending of USDT/USDC in the real world.
💼 Business Model
Revenue: Fixed card issuance fees + 1% transaction fee.
Projections: Estimated $5-7M profit by Year 3.
Funding: Seeking $335,000 for a 15% stake (ROI in 18-24 months).
🛠 Tech Stack (The Vision)
We are in the MVP development stage. We need a robust architecture that connects:
Ethereum / Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)
Smart Contracts (Solidity)
Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) APIs for card issuing
Secure UX/UI for Web and Mobile
